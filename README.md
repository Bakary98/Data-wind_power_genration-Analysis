I'm working on a **WindPowerGeneration** project using **Data Fabric tools** with a **Medallion architecture** setup â€” that is, creating **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

# WindPowerGeneration Project - Medallion Architecture Report

## 1. Project Overview

The WindPowerGeneration project aims to efficiently process, clean, and analyze wind power data using a medallion architecture approach within Data Fabric tools. The medallion architecture helps streamline data processing by organizing data into multiple layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

## 2. Medallion Architecture Layers

### 2.1 Bronze Layer (Raw Data Ingestion)

**Purpose:**

* Capture raw, unprocessed data from wind power sensors, logs, and external sources.
* Store data in its original format with minimal transformations to maintain data fidelity and ensure auditability.

**Typical Data Sources:**

* Wind turbine sensor readings (speed, direction, power output)
* Weather data (temperature, pressure, humidity)
* Operational logs

**Processing:**

* Data ingestion via streaming or batch
* Basic validation (schema checks, duplicate detection)
* Raw data storage in a data lake or distributed file system



### 2.2 Silver Layer (Cleaned and Enriched Data)

**Purpose:**

* Cleanse and enrich Bronze data to make it analysis-ready.
* Handle data quality issues: remove duplicates, fill missing values, standardize formats.
* Combine data from multiple sources for consistency and completeness.

**Processing:**

* Data cleansing (remove outliers, fix errors)
* Data transformation (unit conversion, timestamp normalization)
* Data enrichment (joining weather data with turbine readings)
* Aggregate or filter records for key metrics



### 2.3 Gold Layer (Aggregated and Business-Level Data)

**Purpose:**

* Provide aggregated, highly curated datasets for business intelligence and advanced analytics.
* Support dashboards, reporting, and predictive models for wind power efficiency and forecasting.

**Processing:**

* Aggregations (hourly/daily average power output)
* Calculated KPIs (capacity factor, downtime)
* Time series prepared for ML models and forecasting
* Optimized data models for fast querying

## 3. Data Workflow Summary

1. **Ingest** raw data from wind turbines and weather stations into the Bronze layer.
2. **Clean and transform** data in the Silver layer, enriching it with additional context.
3. **Aggregate and curate** data in the Gold layer to generate business insights and reports.
